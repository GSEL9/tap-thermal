# tapThermal

This repository contains the code developed during a research project I
conducted in 2016 at the chemical department of the University of Oslo.

The
project was supervised by Dr. Evgeniy A. Redekop in the research group of
chemical catalysis.

The goal of the project was assess the influence of a temperature gradient on
the transport parameters estimated from experimental Temporal Analysis of
Products (TAP) data.

A numerical model of the transient diffusion process under the conditions of a
temperature gradient was developed. Non-linear least squares regression was
applied to the numerical model to estimate the transport parameters.

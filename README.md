# tap-thermal

This repository contains the code I developed during a research project conducted in 2016. The project was hosted by the research group of chemical
catalysis at the University of Oslo under the supervision of Dr. Evgeniy A. Redekop, and funded by the Centre for Materials Science and Nanotechnology.

The project aimed at assessing the influence of a temperature gradient on
the transport parameters estimated from experimental Temporal Analysis of
Products (TAP) data. By constructing a numerical model and applying
non-linear least squares regression the transport parameters could be
estimated. Simulations showed that minor adjustments were required for the Knudsen diffusion coefficients in order to account for various simulated gradients.

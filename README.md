# tap-thermal

This repository contains the code developed during a research project I
conducted in 2016. The project was hosted by the research group of chemical
catalysis at the University of Oslo and supervised by Dr. Evgeniy A. Redekop.

The goal of the project was assess the influence of a temperature gradient on
the transport parameters estimated from experimental Temporal Analysis of
Products (TAP) data. By constructing a numerical model and applying
non-linear least squares regression the transport parameters could be
estimated.
